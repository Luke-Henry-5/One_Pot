An upgrade to Venmo/any banking payment apps. Makes it hypothetically easier to make quick payments to people for fast food meals by eliminating calculations and working strictly off of restaurant menus. By using the "Party Code" it allows transactions to be instant and autonomous.
# File Breakdown
"MenuReader.Java", "Menus.txt", "DQ.txt", "Wendys.txt" and the only files that matter. The other files were different attempts of the project
